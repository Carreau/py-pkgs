It’s scope and intent is inspired by the R packages book written by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan. "],
["setup.html", "2 System setup 2.1 Installing and updating Python 2.2 Setting up the RStudio IDE with Python", " 2 System setup 2.1 Installing and updating Python In order to start off on a good footing, we recommend you follow these system set-up instructions so you will run into fewer technical issues (compared to not using the same system this book was designed for). We recommend installing Python 3.7 via the Anaconda distribution, following the instructions here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. If you already have installed this distribution, ensure Python, and the conda package manager is up to date by running the following commands: conda update --all Next, use conda to install Python poetry - a python package that will help us more efficiently build our Python packages: conda install -c conda-forge poetry 2.2 Setting up the RStudio IDE with Python This book will use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) to develop packages, although any Python IDE should work. Note - we do this because in the UBC Master of Data Science program we use both the R and Python programming languages and prefer to use an IDE that works well with both. If you would like to use the RStudio IDE we recommend installing the most recent version of the IDE from the preview site: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/ and then installing R from CRAN, and the reticulate R package via install.package(\"reticulate\") from the R console inside RStudio. When installing reticulate, you will be prompted to install miniconda, if you have already installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, answer “no” to installing miniconda at this prompt. 2.2.1 Find where Anaconda is installed on your machine 2.2.1.1 Mac OS &amp; Linux In terminal, type: which Python 2.2.1.2 Windows In the Anaconda Prompt type: where python. 2.2.2 Configuring reticulate for to use the Python REPL inside RStudio Create a file named .Rprofile in your $HOME directory that contains the following: Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = &quot;path_to_the_folder_containing_anaconda&#39;s_python&quot;) For me the \"path_to_the_folder_containing_anaconda's_python\" was '//anaconda3/bin/'. Restart RStudio for this to take effect. 2.2.3 Configuring the RStudio terminal 2.2.3.1 Mac OS &amp; Linux Open (or create) the file called .bash_profile in your $HOME directory and add the following to the last line of that file: export PATH=&quot;path_to_the_folder_containing_anaconda&#39;s_python:$PATH&quot; For me that line is export PATH=\"//anaconda3/bin:$PATH\". Restart RStudio for this to take effect. 2.2.3.2 Windows The default terminal in RStudio on Windows is PowerShell. This causes some unexpected problems as its not a true bash shell. You should change this using the following menu selections inside RStudio: Global Options -&gt; Terminal -&gt; Shell -&gt; Git Bash "],
["whole-game.html", "3 The Whole Game 3.1 Use Poetry to create a Python project", " 3 The Whole Game This chapter demonstrates how to develop an entire small toy Python package from beginning to end. It’s purpose it to motivate and give a high level overview of how a Python package can and should be developed. Later chapters will delve deeper into important package specifics. 3.1 Use Poetry to create a Python project To create a new Python project with Poetry named foo-categoricals, using the terminal navigate to the parent directory that you wish the project directory to live in and type: $ poetry new foocategoricals Created package foocategoricals in foocategoricals When we do this, Poetry creates a directory with the following structure: /foocategoricals ├── README.md ├── foocategoricals │ └── __init__.py ├── pyproject.toml └── tests ├── __init__.py └── test_foocategoricals.py It gives us a boilerplate file and directory structure suitable for building a Python package, including a file for us to write out Python functions that our package will distribute (foocategoricals/__init__.py), a home for our tests to ensure that our package functions work as we expect they should (tests/__init__.py), as well as a pyproject.toml file that we will use to define our project’s metadata.
