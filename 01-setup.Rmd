## Installing and updating Python {#python-setup}

In order to start off on a good footing, we recommend you follow these system set-up instructions so you will run into fewer technical issues (compared to not using the same system this book was designed for).

We recommend installing Python **3.7** via the Anaconda distribution, following the instructions here: <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>. If you already have installed this distribution, ensure Python, and the `conda` package manager is up to date by running the following commands:

```
$ conda update --all
```

Next, use conda to install [Python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - a python package that will help us more efficiently build our Python packages:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge poetry
```

Finally, we install `cookiecutter` - a python package that will create Python projects from project templates

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Register for a PyPI account

To publish a Python package on PyPI to share with others, you will need to register for a PyPI account. You can do so freely by clicking here: <https://pypi.org/account/register/>

## Setting up the RStudio IDE with Python {#rstudio-python-setup}

This book will use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) to develop packages, although any Python IDE should work. *Note - we do this because in the [UBC Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) we use both the R and Python programming languages and prefer to use an IDE that works well with both.* If you would like to use the RStudio IDE we recommend installing the most recent version of the IDE from the preview site: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/> and then [installing R from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), and the `reticulate` R package via `install.package("reticulate")` from the R console inside RStudio. When installing reticulate, you will be prompted to install miniconda, if you have already installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, answer "no" to installing miniconda at this prompt. 

### Find where Anaconda is installed on your machine

#### Mac OS & Linux
In terminal, type: `which Python`

#### Windows
In the Anaconda Prompt type: `where python`.

### Configuring `reticulate` for to use the Python REPL inside RStudio

Create a file named `.Rprofile` in your `$HOME` directory that contains the following:

```
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "path_to_the_folder_containing_anaconda's_python")
```

For me the `"path_to_the_folder_containing_anaconda's_python"` was `'//anaconda3/bin/'`.

Restart RStudio for this to take effect.

### Configuring the RStudio terminal

#### Mac OS & Linux

Open (or create) the file called `.bash_profile` in your `$HOME` directory and add the following to the last line of that file:

```
export PATH="path_to_the_folder_containing_anaconda's_python:$PATH"
```

For me that line is `export PATH="//anaconda3/bin:$PATH"`.

Restart RStudio for this to take effect.

#### Windows

The default terminal in RStudio on Windows is PowerShell. This causes some unexpected problems as its not a true bash shell. You **should** change this using the following menu selections inside RStudio: Global Options -> Terminal -> Shell -> Git Bash
