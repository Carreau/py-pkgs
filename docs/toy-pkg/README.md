# toy-pkg

This is a simple toy package created to supplement the [Python Packages Book](https://ubc-mds.github.io/py-pkgs/). In particular, this package is used in the [Installed packages](https://ubc-mds.github.io/py-pkgs/content/03-package-structure.html#installed-packages) section of the Package Structure and State Chapter to demonstrate how to install a package "manually" (without the help of a package manager such as `pip` or `conda`).
